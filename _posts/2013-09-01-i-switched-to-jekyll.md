As lots of nerds, I recently switched to jekyll for my personal blog.

What's funny is that I never "really" blogged before. My previous personal website was a simple PHP script I wrote 5+ years ago where I was dumping screenshots and one-liners about my off-hours web developments.

OK Jekyll, let's say I wannabe a blogger because:

* I want to share more, not only one-liners & screenshots
* What I do today may interest lot more people than before
* I â™¥ git and github
* Jekyll simply does the job

See ya !
