The RailsRumble is a 48h contest where the goal is to build a Web application in Ruby on Rails in order to promote the community.

This year, we (Heavyweight rockstars) have made an iPhone application + web site. There were over 230 teams and we finished 15th.

Our tagline: "Ask and Tell Your iPhone where the party at!"
