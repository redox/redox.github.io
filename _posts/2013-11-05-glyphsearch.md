A few days ago, I've discovered [glyphsearch.com](http://glyphsearch.com) reading [HN](http://news.ycombinator.com): totally awesome! I can't count the number of times I opened my browser on [fontawesome.io](http://fontawesome.io) or [getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com) to find an icon. That's just what all developers need :)

I took the liberty of forking the project to plug [Algolia's Search API](http://www.algolia.com/doc/rest_api) and provide a better search experience: [https://github.com/thomaspark/glyphsearch/pull/1](https://github.com/thomaspark/glyphsearch/pull/1).

New features includes:

* highlighting
* typo-tolerance
* matching fields priority (matching on the name is better than matching on the tags)

I hope you'll like it !

_EDIT_: [merged](https://github.com/thomaspark/glyphsearch/pull/1#issuecomment-27910904)!
