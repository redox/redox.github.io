This weekend has held the contest Railsrumble (Railsrumble 2008) and I had the chance to participate. The goal was simple: 48 hours to create a kick-ass web application.

The 240 teams faced were composed of 1 to 4 members. I'm teaming up with Ivan Schneider and Jessy Bernal from Massive Brain Games.

Our project is called rbDB and was developed in Ruby on Rails. rbDB is a RoR mysql administrator based on conventions.
